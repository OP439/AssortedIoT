# AssortedIoT
Assorted files from IoT that were never added to Github in the development process.

The raspberry pi was running a full desktop OS so the Geany Python editor was used to create and edit code. The newer versions of Linux enforce the use of venv environment in Python or throw up an error so effort was spent familiarising with the venv process. This proved to be a good thing to learn and will be taken forward on the developer journey. 

The arduino and esp's needed to be flashed everytime the code changed so keeping changes to a minimum was essential. Because of this, the code was kept very similar to examples found online and not a lot of effort was put into developing it further.
